       ' Venture capital (VC) is a type of private equity financing that is typically provided to early-stage, high-potential, and growth-oriented startups or companies that have demonstrated the potential for significant returns on investment. VC firms or funds invest in these companies in exchange for an ownership stake in the form of equity or convertible debt.',

       'The goal of venture capital is to provide capital and other resources to help early-stage companies grow and become successful. In addition to providing financial support, VC firms often offer strategic guidance and industry connections to help their portfolio companies succeed.',

        'VC firms typically raise money from institutional investors such as pension funds, endowments, and high-net-worth individuals, and they use this capital to invest in promising startups. VC investments are high-risk, high-reward, and typically involve a long-term time horizon before a successful exit (such as an IPO or acquisition) is achieved.'

          title: 'Disrupting the healthcare industry',
          content: ['Together with a colleague, he befriended during his White House fellowship, Glueck started a last-minute travel deals website that grew to over $100 million in sales when it was acquired by Travelocity. As chief marketing officer at Travelocity, he helped launch the company’s iconic Roaming Gnome ad campaign featuring a world-traveling gnome, helping to build the company into a travel powerhouse whose annual sales soared from $3.5 billion to $11 billion during his tenure.',

         ' He then took the helm at Foursquare, helping to revive a company that started as a social network famous for allowing users to “check in” to locations and earning digital badges for achievements. When he finished his nearly six-year stint as CEO, Foursquare had reinvented itself as a B2B business with revenues roughly ten times higher than when Glueck arrived.',
          
          'Now Glueck is applying that same knack for disruption to the healthcare industry — gut medicine, specifically — as co-founder of Salvo Heath, offering a virtual clinic for people affected by chronic gastrointestinal problems. Glueck and his partners are looking to increase patient access to the best specialty healthcare, matching users with an online medical care team that will help them plan everything from a nutrition regimen to sleep and mental health management as well as diagnostic testing or medications.',]

          title: 'United Re-imagining the future of healthcare',
          content: [' Twice, medical imaging failed Alex Dresner’s family, resulting in missed diagnoses and delayed treatment. The first instance occurred when a radiology report failed to identify lung cancer in Alex’s father, leading to a terminal outcome due to the late diagnosis. Years later, Alex experienced a similar ordeal, receiving a false-negative report before a second opinion correctly identified his cancer. His own struggle with the healthcare system and the inadequacies of diagnostic imaging left him wondering why the system couldn’t do better.',

         ' This experience ultimately became a turning point in Alex’s life and career, as he co-founded Imagen, a company dedicated to changing the way patients get diagnosed, treated, and managed. Imagen offers the first-ever diagnostics-as-a-service (DaaS) platform, partnering with primary care physicians to provide imaging capabilities directly in their offices. The platform provides everything needed for diagnostics, including equipment, staff, specialists, and internally developed, FDA-cleared AI software.',
          
          'Currently, few primary care physicians (PCPs) have in-office imaging capabilities, resulting in over 1,000 patients per year being referred to high-cost and hard-to-access care settings. Imagen’s platform changes this by providing patients with immediate diagnostic tests, results, and next steps all in one visit to their PCP.',
          
          'By enabling PCPs to provide on-site diagnostic imaging, Imagen is helping to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and improve patient outcomes. Imagen’s DaaS platform is setting a new standard for healthcare, and Alex and his team at Imagen are at the forefront of this movement.',
          
          'We caught up with Alex to talk about the future of primary care and the impact Imagen is having on the healthcare industry.',]

Her company, Benepass, develops benefits management software so administrators can deliver employees access to everything from meals to mental wellness on an easy-to-use platform. It also centralizes all employee tax-advantaged accounts with a mobile app that employees can use to request reimbursements while including links to physical and virtual payment cards.',

          title: 'A Compensation Conversation for 2023',
          content: ['This year, amidst a talent landscape shaped by market, pandemic, and geopolitical headwinds, we conducted our first annual compensation survey. Our approach was guided by conversations held earlier in the year with founders and people leaders in our portfolio. Instead of raw compensation data, their resounding request was for real-time benchmarks on topics like equity refresh timing, sales compensation structures, board compensation, and the approach to geo-based pay.',

          'Based on our survey findings, we identified three areas that get top billing in 2023 planning: compensation transparency, equity refresh strategies, and employee education regarding equity. Below we explain why we believe each is a significant priority for decision-makers to address in the upcoming year.',
